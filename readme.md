# Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Erlang for building an interactive pattern-matching game. The goal of the game is for the user to guess a hidden pattern composed of three randomly selected atoms (like `a`, `b`, `c`) from a predefined list.

As a software engineer focused on learning functional programming and concurrent systems, I built this project to gain practical experience with Erlang's core concepts—such as pattern matching, recursion, message passing, and list processing. Through this hands-on approach, I deepened my understanding of Erlang’s syntax and functional paradigm.

# Development Environment

- **Operating System**: Windows 10
- **Text Editor**: Visual Studio Code with Erlang plugin
- **Terminal**: Erlang Eshell (V16.0.2)
- **Language**: Erlang

I used the standard Erlang/OTP environment to write and test the program, and implemented all logic using core language features without third-party libraries.

# Future Work


* Improve input validation using `try/catch` to handle unexpected inputs
* Run the game logic in a separate process to demonstrate concurrency
* Add difficulty levels (e.g., longer patterns or more symbol options)
* Create a scoreboard for tracking the number of attempts
